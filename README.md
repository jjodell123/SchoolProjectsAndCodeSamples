# SchoolProjectsNotice
Hey! I have a bunch more school projects that display more of my recent and complex code examples in the organization JJ-Odell-School-Projects. While I cannot make these public in case future students attempt to plagiarize their work off of me, I can add recruiters or anyone interested in viewing them (that is not a current or future student in any of the courses) as members of the organization to give them read access. Send me a quick email at jjodell123@gmail.com with your github username or the email linked to the account so I can add you :)
